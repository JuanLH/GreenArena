== this doesn't affect anything anyway, no point trying to fix it
java.util.prefs.WindowsPreferences <init> 
WARNING: Could not open/create prefs root node Software\JavaSoft\Prefs 
at root 0x80000002. Windows RegCreateKeyEx(...) returned error code 5.

Cause:
The error occurs because java.util.prefs.WindowsPreferences is trying to save information in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\JavaSoft\Prefs instead of under HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\JavaSoft\Prefs.
Environment
Windows 7 64-bit
Resolving the problem
The work around is to login as the administrator and create the key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\JavaSoft\Prefs.
